            <p>Nature is just something I enjoy and so it's what inspired the poem</p>
            <p>
                Snow was melting quick<br>
                Flowers waking up from sleep<br>
                Warm sun shines on earth<br>

                I really enjoy gaming. It is something that I have been doing since I was a kid. I really enjoy them because I feel
                they really help one learn to problem solve and how to learn to become better at something. There are always moments
                that you can fail but you learn from your mistakes and can move on.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am really into programming. I enjoy problem solving and I am really determined to solve any issue that comes my way. 
                With programming I feel that there are many ways to solve a problem and I enjoy that about it. There is no right answer,
                but there could always be a faster way to do things. It's something that is always changing and I enjoy that about it.
                There is always something new to learn every day.
            </p>

                Being outdoors is something that always has been something I like to do. There is nothing that compares to being outside
                and getting some fresh air. A lot of the times when I need to think, I go to the mountains so that I can have a more
                peaceful place to think about issues that I have or things that I need to solve.
